# CodeX
A chatbot built with vanilla javascript and OpenAI API.

CodeX is an application I bulit while learning javascript with VITE. With vanilla javascriot as the language of coding, the Back-End(server) is built with Node.js and Express. I used an OpenAI API conect the server to the information source. Because the API is not available in the repo, you'll need to get one from OpenAI API.

You can use this code as your own project to add to your porfolio by cloning this repo.
All you need is the following:
 # Install Node.js
    https://nodejs.org/en/
 # Install Vite.
    npm create vanilla@latest client --template vanilla, click y, 
    select vanilla, 
    select javascript.
    cd into client, run (npm install) in your terminal to install all node packages.

All the rest is just pure javascript.

# To start the app,
    npm run dev

# To start the server,
     npm run server
